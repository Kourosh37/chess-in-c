Place sound effects in this folder using the exact filenames below:

ui_click.wav
piece_move.wav
piece_capture.wav
piece_castle.wav
piece_promotion.wav
king_check.wav
game_over.wav
lobby_join.wav

Notes:
- Any file may be missing; the game will keep running silently for that event.
- Supported formats depend on raylib build, WAV is recommended for compatibility.
